IFTTT like project - events on third party clients

# Description

This project is a mobile app, where users can connect and create various event over third party APIs, such as Youtube, Spotify, and some others.
It has been made as an Epitech project, and all the code you will see here has been written by myself.

The mobile app was made using React Native and Typescript, bundled with Expo Go.

You can run the app by using the following commands:
```bash
$> npm install
$> npx expo start
```

Then you can scan the QR code, either with the Expo Go app on android, or using the camera on Iphone.

Unfortunatley, I could not retreive the back-end, so the app will not work proplerly. But I will be pleased to answers to any questions you may have.
